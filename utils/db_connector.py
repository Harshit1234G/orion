class DatabaseConnector:
    """
    A context manager for connecting to a sqlite database.

    Usage:
    ```
    with DatabaseConnector() as connector:
        # Use the connector to perform database operations within this block
        # The connection and cursor are automatically closed when the block exits.
    ```

    Attributes:
    - `db`: Represents the sqlite database connection.
    - `cursor`: Represents the database cursor used for executing SQL queries.
    The attributes `db` and `cursor` are created upon entering the context and are used for database operations.

    Example:
    ```
    with DatabaseConnector() as connector:
        connector.cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM students;")
        results = connector.cursor.fetchall()
        for row in results:
            print(row)
    ```

    Note:
    - Ensure that the sqlite server is running and accessible with the provided credentials.
    - It is recommended to use the `with` statement to ensure proper resource cleanup.
    - The `exc_tb` parameter is related to exception handling and is provided by the `with` statement when an exception occurs.
